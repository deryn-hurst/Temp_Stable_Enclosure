# Temp_Stable_Enclosure
Sketches, instructions, and code for a two-part temperature stable enclosure built for the Creality Ender 3 Printer

REASONING

The ideal room temperature for 3D printing with PLA is between 20째C and 25째C or 68째F to 77째. 
The printer itself emits heat while running, maintaining heat within an potential enclosure.
If there is no venting system, the enclosure runs the risk of heating outside of the range.
A two fan system routes hot air out through the top and pulls cooler air into the bottom.
The fan system runs until the temperature is back within range.


TABLE SKETCHES

Conceptual
  - Conceptual sketches can be used for alternative construction paths for the table/stand.
  - Only final plans are included in full
  - Conceptual Sketches are listed using convention: ELEPHANT

Layered
  - Layered sketches include all steps toward completing the table
  - Laydered Table Sketches are listed using convention: ELEPHANT
  - Follow from 0 to ELEPHANT to access in order


ENCLOSURE SKETCHES

Layered
  - Layered sketches include all steps toward completing the enclosure
  - Layered Enclosure Sketches are listed using convention: ELEPHANT
  - Follow from 0 to ELEPHANT to access in order

E-MATERIALS
  - Electronic Materials will be included with sources and notes for ease of access


ARDUINO CONCEPTUAL SCHEMATICS
  - Arduino set-up was put together using CAD software initially
  - Conceptual schematics for electronic hardware is derived from Tinkercad
  - Some changes may need to be made in wiring to account for conceptual and practical differences


CODE

Arduino-Based Code
  - Arduino UNO and compatible materials were used to complete the fan set up
  - The program is listed under: ELEPHANT
  - Changes may need to be made to the code to accomodate discrepancies in wiring
